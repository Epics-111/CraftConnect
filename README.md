JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
REACT_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your_encryption_key>
```
Ensure that the ENCRYPTION_KEY in your .env file is 32 bytes long (64 hex characters)

### Frontend `.env`
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
